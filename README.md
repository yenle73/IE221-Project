# IE221-Project
The project is conducted for my Python Programming Course - IE221. An overview of the project is to build a movie recommendation system based on 3 approaches: content-based, sentiment-based, and collaborative-recommendation. For the first two methods, the project utilizes natural language processing techniques to convert text into vectors and calculates the similarity between vectors using the cosine similarity measure. For the collaborative-recommendation approach, I employed the KNN model from the scikit-learn library and used the Euclidean distance measure to calculate similarity.
